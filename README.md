Camerata Singers
================

The Camerata Singers of Lake Forest, under the direction of Julia Davids, was a 16-voice chamber choir which performed an eclectic repertoire of music, ranging from the Middle Ages to the Modern Era. Their performance encompassed a broad spectrum of styles from the classical to folk and multi-cultural, as well as popular genres. Each season Camerata presented a series of four Sunday afternoon concerts in Lake Forest, Illinois, and the surrounding area. Their programs were built around particular themes, either musical or non-musical.
