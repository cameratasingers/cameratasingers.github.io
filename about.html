The group,a 16-voice choir, performed a repertoire spanning centuries and encompassing Classical to Broadway and beyond.  The innovative programs featured choral works, chamber works and solos. Each season consisted of a series of four Sunday afternoon concerts in the Lake Forest area. Concerts were given in some of the most remarkable homes in the area. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since its inception
in 1980, the organization has been interested in combining fine choral
music with the splendid homes the Lake Forest area. This presentation style is reminiscent of concerts performed in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries where singers and guests could mingle in an intimate and meaningful way. Over the years, Camerata has performed in more than 35 magnificent residences in the Lake Forest/Lake Bluff area.  Many of these residences are included in our photo gallery of older homes.  All of the photo galleries can be accessed by clicking on the "Site Map" button to the left of this screen.  Our audiences enjoyed listening to beautiful music in homes designed by such master architects as Frank Lloyd Wright, David Adler, Howard Van Doren Shaw, Benjamin Marshall, Harrie Thomas Lindeberg, and Arthur Heun, and the companies of Holabird and Root, amd Delano and Aldrich.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After each concert
the audience was treated to an elegant reception of appetizers, wine
and desserts. Concerts requiring an organ were usually given in the sanctuary of a local church.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Camerata occasionally performed with other music organizations such as the Lake Forest
Symphony and the Westminster Chamber Orchestra.</font></p>
